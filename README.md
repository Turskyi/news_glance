# News Glance

News Glance is a flutter app that lets you access the latest news and insights from your home
screen widget. It uses AI to generate a conclusion from the news headlines and allows you to view
and share the articles.

# Getting Started

## To create generated files, run:

```
dart run build_runner clean
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Credits

This project is based on the codelab
[Adding a Home Screen widget to your Flutter App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/flutter-home-screen-widgets)
by Leigha Jarett and Eric Windmill.
